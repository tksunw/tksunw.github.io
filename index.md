I am, in reverse chronological order, a father, husband, brother, and son.

In my personal life, I enjoy cooking, reading books, drinking wine, and spending time in the outdoors.

In my professional life I am essentially a "Solutions Architect", but which I mean I use 20+ years of experience 
in networking, storage systems, various server operating systems, and various virtualization technologies to design
solutions to business needs.  

I believe that automation is the key to predictable and repeatable outcomes, and I my main goal at any job is to
automate my way out of that job.

This blog probably won't have any of the big design solutions I've worked on for employers, but will instead have 
tidbits that have been useful to me over the years.  This is an online notebook mainly for myself, because I forget
things if I don't write them down.  If you get some use out of it, that's great, too.
