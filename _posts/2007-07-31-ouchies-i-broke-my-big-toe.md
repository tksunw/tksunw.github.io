I was carrying my son (15 months old) down the steps, and I slipped. My only thought was "Don't let Jason get hurt."

When I lost my footing, I prioritized protecting my child by wrapping my arms around him as I fell. My left foot missed a step and my right foot slipped, with my toes folding underneath while bearing my full weight of 250 pounds.

My son escaped injury, though Jason was frightened by his father's screaming.

I drove myself to the hospital at 8:45 AM after dropping my son at daycare. After X-rays and receiving a post-op shoe, I was managing pain with Advil and ice-packs.

I'm uncertain about whether surgery will be necessary, pending an orthopedic specialist consultation scheduled for the end of the week.
