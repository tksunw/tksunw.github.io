I broke my big toe. I went to the hospital and had them X-RAY it. And, it's broke!

I was carrying my son (15 months old) down the steps, and I slipped. My only though was "Don't let Jason get hurt."

So I grabbed him and wrapped my arms around him, as my left foot missed a step, and my right foot slipped off the step it was on, hitting the step below that toe first, which toes consequently folded underneath that foot at the same time as they became the primary weight bearers for all 250 lbs of me.

Jason was not hurt. I think he was scared that daddy was screaching like his 19-month old cousin Jade when they're fighting over a toy (actually he's the screacher, not her), but he was fine.

Here's a pic of the X-RAY:

After I hurt myself, I took about 5 minutes to gather my wits, then I took Jason to daycare, and drove
myself to the hospital, which is quite pleasant at 8:45 AM.

A few X-RAYS, and a silly post-op shoe later, and here I am on a diet of Advil and ice-packs. Hopefully the bones won't need to be pinned in place, but I won't find out till the end of the week, when I have a follow-up with the orthopedic specialist.
